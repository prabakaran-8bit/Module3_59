# Requirements

# Abstract
- A Keyless Entry System allows the car to lock or unlock without the Mechenical key  
- The key fob doesn't need to be presented to  handle car body . it just needs to be within range for the sensors to pick up the signal
- Here in our Project this system is implemented using Led's 

# Introduction:

- A BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. 
- This system can check the window status, Alarm status, Battery info, Door status. 
- The status of all the above system can be verified through the led's





# Swot Analysis
## Strengths
- We can use with less power
- Not connected to the internet


## Weakness
- •	We can only lock and unlock the system within the required range 
- complex System 


## opportunities
- Advancement in Technology.
- Low cost and economical


## Threats
- Components damage 
- Power failure cant have charge backup until resolved
